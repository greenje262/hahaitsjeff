                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>Recently, I took some classes in HTML and CSS to be able to code up static and responsive websites. It's not the first time I've built websites, but the first time since the Microsoft FrontPage days. Creating and organizing websites is something I have a lot of fun doing, and would be happy to work with you to make sure yours tells your story the way you'd like it to. You can see some examples of websites I've made here and here.</p>

                    <h3>Haha, it's Jeff!</h3>
                    <p>My personal blog (and the namesake for this website) used to be hosted on Wordpress. Originally a way to catalogue my running race reports, it's evolved over time to cover a broader range of topics. In addition to the writing and the cartoons, managing the blog gave me some good experience with Wordpress as a CMS. I think <a target="_blank" href="https://hahaitsjeff.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/try-just-licking-the-peanut-butter-off-the-bread/">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://hahaitsjeff.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/you-alright-there-sport/">this</a> are a couple of my better articles. You can find the whole blog on Wordpress <a target="_blank" href="https://hahaitsjeff.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Deck of Many Games</h3>
                    <p>In September 2020, I started a yearlong challenge to make a video game in one week, every week, for a year. The idea is to get in the habit of creating and releasing finished works, understanding what my capabilities are, and becoming proficient in a wide variety of game development tools. I publish all these games for free on itch.io, and you can find the entire collection <a target="_blank" href="https://jeefjerfy.itch.io/">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Dimbus Runs</h3>
                    <p>A few years ago, I picked up a GoPro and started bringing it with me on runs and hikes. Though the endeavor was, at its core, a vanity project, I fell in love with the way the camera encouraged me to consider my surroundings, and had a lot of fun editing the footage to create short, entertaining videos. These videos gave me a lot of experience with Lightworks, a powerful video editing software, as well as Audacity. I recently bought a new action camera and have been playing around with making videos again. You can check out the old ones on YouTube <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_3FA2AdEvOZZd_xmjtoXw">here</a>, and any new ones on Vimeo <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/user121506058">here</a>.</p>
